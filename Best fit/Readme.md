# Best Fit

The best-fit deals with allocating the smallest free partition which meets the requirement of the requesting process. This algorithm first searches the entire list of free partitions and considers the smallest space that is adequate. It then tries to find a space that is close to the actual process size needed.

# Advantage

Memory utilization is much better as it searches the smallest free partition first available.

# Disadvantage
It is slower and may even tend to fill up memory.


## How to Run

Run the main.cpp in any C++ IDE
