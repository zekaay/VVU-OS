# Round Robin Scheduling
This is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.

# Advantages

-Each process is provided a fixed time to execute.
-Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and another process executes for a given time period.

-Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes


## How to Run

Run the main.cpp in any C++ IDE
