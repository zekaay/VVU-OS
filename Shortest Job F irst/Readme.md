# Shortest Job First Scheduling Algorithm(SJF)
This is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. 

# Advantage

-The best approach to minimize waiting time.

-Easy to implement in Batch systems where required CPU time is known in advance.

# Disadvantage

-It is Impossible to implement in interactive systems where the required CPU time is not known.

-The processer should know in advance how much time the process will take.
## How to Run

Run the main.cpp in any C++ IDE
